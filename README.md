This is a simple Web Forum using Java Servlets and PostgreSQL.

It was created as the final peer-reviewed assignment for a [MOOC on Java advanced concepts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/desenvolvimento-agil-com-java-avancado/) on Coursera.

**DISCLAIMER**: *This application is not supposed to be deployed. It's intended just a didactic exercise in Java programming.*
